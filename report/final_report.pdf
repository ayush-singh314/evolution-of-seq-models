This is a placeholder file for the final report PDF.
The actual report will be generated after running all experiments and analyzing the results.

The report will include:
1. Introduction to sequence models
2. Detailed analysis of each architecture
3. Performance comparisons
4. Training curves and visualizations
5. Discussion of trade-offs and use cases
6. Conclusions and future directions

To generate the actual report:
1. Run all experiment scripts
2. Use the analysis notebooks to create visualizations
3. Compile results into a comprehensive PDF report.
